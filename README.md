right, here's the rules:

1. any pull request you make must contain one line of code only
2. you may not remove lines of code
3. anyone can add a line of code wherever they want, including in the middle of something someone else is trying to make
4. please don't purposely create syntax errors or otherwise fuck this up for people
5. your pull request will only be accepted if the last two pull requests were by different people to you
6. don't use weird shit like semicolons to put multiple lines of code into one (thanks garden ornament)
